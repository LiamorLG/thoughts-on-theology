* Jesus was never married
This makes a lot of sense.
I highly doubt Jesus was ever married to a woman.

Hebrews 11:39: And all these, having gained approval through their faith, did not receive what was promised,
Hebrews 11:40: because God had provided something better for us, so that apart from us they would not be made perfect.

Matthew 22:30: For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.
Mark 12:25: For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.

Matthew 26:29: I tell you I will not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.
Mark 14:25: Truly, I say to you, I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.
Luke 22:18: For I tell you that from now on I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.
